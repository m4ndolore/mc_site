As tactical environments shift toward more dispersed and decentralized camps, warfighters and responders face growing risks to safety, readiness, and continuity from traditional fuel-based power systems. BKPK answers with rugged, single-person-portable battery systems that provide power when and where it’s needed — no noise, no fuel, no delay. Built to withstand harsh handling and extreme field conditions, each unit is drop-proof, waterproof (including its connectors), and engineered for reliable performance in any environment. The system is designed to be stupid-proof in the field—intuitive, tool-free, and resistant to common operator error, even under pressure. The modular packs work alone or in swarms, with composability from one to thousands, drawing from any source and adapting to mission needs with built-in edge intelligence.\n\nCurrently at TRL 5, BKPK’s Gen 5 units are undergoing lab testing and will enter field trials in Q3 2025 through a DLX-led zero-fuel camp pilot. Additional trials with military and emergency response teams are in planning. With over $45M in commercial MOUs and active partner pathways in solar, drone, and defense logistics, BKPK is scaling fast. Backed by 30+ IP vectors and a veteran team from NASA, Accenture, Daimler, Motorola, Flex, and Jabil, BKPK is not a science project — it’s a mission-ready energy platform built for defense, response, and the future of distributed power.",

This endangers warfighters and flummoxes integration architects:\n-- One node acts as leader or hub—disable it, and coordination collapses.  \n-- No shared state: each drone has a different view of the mission\n-- No consensus: tasks are duplicated, dropped, or never completed\n-- Timing is inconsistent: one node thinks it’s 14:00, another 14:03\n-- Integrators are stuck writing fragile glue code to hold everything together\n-- New nodes require manual trust/config — no dynamic mesh, no resilience\n-- Updates risk “bricking” nodes without orchestration or rollback\n\nThe result: warfighters babysit machines, and autonomy can't scale.\n\nSolution\nAltiro by Cachai is a distributed autonomy engine that enables real-time state sharing, consensus, and coordination across heterogeneous platforms—with no cloud, no central brain, and no single point of failure.\n\nValidation\nAt the July 2025 OUSD(R&E) T-REX event, we maintained a live Kubernetes cluster across multiple Raspberry Pis over wireless. These nodes shared mission state as a stand-in for live autonomous vehicles. August demos add vehicle integration. Logs and video available on request.\n\nAnticipated traction:\n$600K subcontract from Leidos (DEVCOM, late 2025)\n$100K NGREA-funded deployment via INDOPACOM units\n$1M follow-on OTA in pipeline (T-REX, AFWERX, xTech, SOCOM)\nCharging $30K for commercial pilots; 10+ expected in next 12 months\n\nStrategic Edge\nMost distributed systems experts are trained on hyperscale cloud. We built Altiro from first principles for the tactical edge. Patent pending. Two-year head start. No one else is this far along.\n\nUser\nAltiro is \"used\" by GS-12–14 autonomy engineers at primes, not the warfighter directly.

This disconnect creates a mission-critical problem: SOF operators make split-second tactical decisions based on outdated intelligence while their ISR platforms collect real-time data that never reaches them.\nOur product, the Distributed Data Framework, is an open source data integration and interoperability platform that enables federated data discovery, processing, transformation, and dissemination. We've deployed operationally across NGA enterprise GEOINT discovery systems, Air Force intelligence processing applications, C2 messaging for high altitude platforms, and SOF team integration at classified exercises.\nAt TRL 9, our system is fully operational and proven in mission-critical environments across multiple DoD programs with demonstrated reliability and interoperability. Founder Jay McNallie brings deep intelligence system architectural experience from Octo/Connexta, combined with an open-source approach that prevents vendor lock-in while enabling NATO interoperability capabilities.\nMarket access comes through established DoD relationships and direct contracts with NGA and USAF. Beyond defense, our federated data mesh extends to energy grid monitoring, supply chain logistics, and border security.\nWhile competitors like Palantir offer proprietary solutions, we differentiate through open standards delivering superior real-time data access from enterprise to tactical edge. For SOF team leaders commanding world-class sensors but unable to access real-time feeds, our framework transforms reconnaissance capabilities into immediate tactical advantage when seconds matter most.",

      "description": "Combat medics, aircrews & vehicle operators lack scalable, on-demand CASEVAC & cargo solutions in contested environments. 85–95% of platforms—aircraft, watercraft, & ground vehicles—cannot move casualties or bulk cargo without rigid, pre-installed systems, resulting in dangerous delays & mission inflexibility. Rigid Inflatable Combat Systems (RICS) is a modular, inflatable system that rapidly converts any aircraft, boat, or ground vehicle into a high-capacity CASEVAC or cargo platform, doubling or tripling its usable capacity. It packs into a duffel bag, deploys without tools & integrates into the host platform without permanent modification. Selected for Army Futures Command’s Concept Focused Warfighting Experiment (CFWE), RICS is also engaged with SOFWERX, PD MEDEVAC, MECCD, & the Army Surgeon General’s Office. It is currently at TRL 6, with successful structural load testing, field inflation trials, & initial platform fitment completed. RICS is protected by patents & a proprietary RF-welding process that enables high-strength inflatable structures using UHMWPE-reinforced TPU composites. We’re entering the market through DoD experimentation, with a plan to advance to TRL 9 & begin direct sales via rapid acquisition pathways. Commercially, the same architecture will disrupt the $25B scaffolding industry with modular inflatable platforms that install 10–50× faster than rigid alternatives. My co-founder Warren Reasner has over 17 years of hands-on experience in RF-welding & inflatable systems design & manufacturing. Unlike rigid MEDVAC systems that are heavy, expensive, & vehicle-specific, RICS is universal, affordable, & field-deployable. Without RICS, operators resort to placing patients on the floor or strapping cargo in ad hoc ways—RICS fills that gap in minutes.",

Grid upgrades cost ≈ $1.3 M / MW and take years, while the stop-gap “genset + UPS + battery trailer” is loud, fuel-hungry, and risky: JP-8 convoys run $100–$400 / gal and invite casualties.\nElectricFish solves this with ANCHOR, a C-130-deployable microgrid that unifies a 400 kWh battery, 350 kW bidirectional charger, and patented Stargazer™ AI to deliver 99.99 % power quality in < 20 ms on a 30 kW feeder or JP-8 genset, then monetize idle kWh through grid services.\nThe core 350² hardware is field-proven—six commercial units have been deployed since 2022, twenty-five more shipping next year—placing ANCHOR at TRL 8. Four issued U.S. patents (11,769,094; 11,681,967; 11,270,243; 11,007,891) cover our ML-driven micro-grid optimization and extreme-fast-charge resource adequacy, creating a strong moat, while a sealed, liquid-cooled design and physics-informed degradation control ensure reliable, all-climate operation from -40 °C to +55 °C. Go-to-market begins with our fleet-charging sales channel, then spins off variants—ANCHOR for expeditionary energy, XDC for edge data centers—into DoD via AFWERX TACFI, DIU CSOs, PM E2S2 OTAs, NavalX Tech Bridges, and NSIC hardware acceleration, scaling to IDIQs with primes already serving Navy and Army bases. Dual-use opportunities span commercial fleets, utility VPPs, disaster relief, and colocation GPUs, tapping a $10 B+ market. ",

      "description": "HES is focused on cybersecurity schemes for cryptographic key vulnerabilities in jammed, Zero-Trust environments. For terminal devices like UASs, the keys are vulnerable when they’re stored in memory or are transmitted through unsecured networks in data packets. With signal jamming, most UAS data packets are only able to handle about 20-25% bad bits before they become unusable for the tactical operators and mission analysts. The critical problem is ensuring usable data packets get through to UASs even with bad bits in the transmission. More usable packets mean lower latencies and smoother operation. Stronger cybersecurity around the keys is 100% needed. \n\nOur lightweight, quantum-resistant protocols (TRL 4) enable ground-to-terminal device key recovery in jammed/poor networks. The ephemeral keys are regenerated on demand, in real time, and never stored. Even with 45% bad bits in the transmission, the keys are error-free.\n\nCo-founder Bertrand Cambou is an expert in physical unclonable functions, ternary computing, quantum key distribution, and device fingerprinting for secure authentication, with our methods protected by 80+ issued/pending patents. His experience includes Gemplus, Ingenico, Crocus, SST, AMD, and Motorola.\n\nWith foundational research funded by AFRL, we are funded by ARL’s Program FREEDOM and on track for field testing at Kostas Research Institute, championed by Sean Pascoli (ARL) and Donald Telesca (AFRL). We are going after SBIR/DIU/BAA opportunities and have partnered with defense consultant Alex Dely of Raytheon for contracts with primes and other funding. Our cyber schemes are applicable across public key infrastructures and device security, with dual-use in fintech and autonomous systems, including crypto wallet security with the ability to regenerate the private key as a service, as well as sensor cybersecurity for autonomous systems.",

      "description": "Over 70% of facilities lack predictive maintenance (PdM) systems, and 51% cite high cost as the main barrier. This leaves critical infrastructure vulnerable to disruptions that damage cash flow, valuation, and forecasting. Where PdM is missing or partial, businesses face 5–15% more downtime, 5–20% higher labor and inventory costs, and 3–5% higher equipment costs. Facilities lose over $300K annually to downtime, with direct losses exceeding $50K per hour and additional costs from SLA penalties, reputational harm, and delayed operations. Our pilot will demonstrate how Theia improves these metrics across industries. Most PdM and IIoT efforts fail to meet expectations due to poor backend integration, support, and lifecycle planning—leading to user frustration, disillusionment, and mission drag. Theia addresses these shortfalls head-on with an operator-informed design and scalable architecture. For the DoD, energy awareness is a mission enabler—from platform readiness to strategic deterrence. Losing energy or the ability to monitor it compromises operations and limits warfighter capacity to project power and execute NSS objectives. The need for a reliable, cost-effective, and scalable PdM solution is urgent—and Theia delivers just that.  Companies lose over $300k/yr due to facility downtime. On average, facilities lose over $50,000 hr. in direct costs due to downtime (with additional costs",

      "description": "Optics support defense systems from laser communications to Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance sensors, and commercial systems such as virtual reality glasses and self-driving vehicles. With laser communications, forces can communicate with greater bandwidth and smaller risk. And sensors are the limiting factor in problems from autonomy to counter-UAV systems. Optical materials have advanced rapidly, but humans' ability to use them has not kept up.\n\nArtificial intelligence can explore more designs, helping humans find the best fit faster. With AI, we can design for real world conditions at the beginning rather than identify issues late in the process.\n\nOur strategic advantage is that we understand both the problem and the solution. Aaron Margolis is an AI expert featured in the New York Times, and Alan Geller is an optical systems designer with almost 20 years of experience supporting both commercial and defense customers and 12 years running his own firm.\n\nOur biggest competitive concern is existing optical systems design software firms, who are too committed to current products to disrupt the market. Another startup working on AI for opitc but focused on a 3D printed lens with limited capability.\n\nWe are pre-field, still at level 2 TRL, but planning for validation in 2026. We're doing problem discovery and looking for partners in research labs, original equipment manufacturers, and primes. We're applying to SBIRs, competitions, and other RFPs. Example problems include helping naval vessels and planes communicate without giving away positions. Another is autonomous ISR units sending data without fiber optic cables.\n\nEvery year, optics supports $2T of commercial products, from cameras to diagnostics, and $400B in defense. SATCOM is a $150B field, ripe for disruption from lasers with 5x the bandwidth.  And all these areas are all growing at 5-10% annually.",

      "description": "Mission software teams struggle with speed. While AI offers acceleration, DoD programs lack secure, compliant deployment for autonomous workflows, especially in IL5+ and disconnected environments. The issue isn't model access, but operationalizing them securely and repeatedly across the full software lifecycle. Crystal Tower solves this. It's a secure, AI-native software factory enabling governed, provable, and deployable agent workflows that boost developer output 10–20x, transforming DevSecOps into secure cognition. Already fielded in 5GAT, PEO-STRI UnITE, and Kessel Run, Crystal Tower supports govt and vendor teams delivering critical capabilities today. With a TRL-9, it's deployed in live environments, driving outcomes, meeting compliance and Zero Trust. Crystal Tower's foundation—a ModSecOps framework for agent governance, prompt control, and cognitive auditability, integrated into hardened IL4+ pipelines—makes it hard to replicate. This, plus early traction through SBIR, AFWERX, and leading primes, gives Radius Method a durable lead. The platform extends to energy, AI safety, and autonomous logistics, where secure, accountable automation is crucial. Radius Method’s team brings firsthand commercial and government expertise from Platform One, Kessel Run, TRMC, and PEO STRI, having deployed platforms where others failed. While others focus on tools or model access, Crystal Tower delivers operational agent workflows with built-in governance, fielded today. Our users are software leads, test teams, and DevOps engineers in classified and tactical programs. Their reality: brittle pipelines, long compliance delays, and inability to integrate AI. Crystal Tower replaces this with secure, compliant, agent-enabled workflows, accelerating delivery without compromising control.",

Traditional aircraft require long runways and fuel convoys. That logistics footprint is vulnerable and unsustainable. In some cases, it takes 7 gallons of fuel to deliver one. Rune Aero is developing an autonomous, low-noise hybrid-electric cargo aircraft capable of short takeoff and landing. It’s designed to deliver meaningful payloads where large transports can’t go and small UAVs can’t carry enough while reducing fuel consumption.\nPre-field. We’re conducting all-electric subscale prototype flight testing, and are preparing for hybrid-electric propulsion (HEP) hardware development, and flight testing. \nCurrently at TRL 4 with working subscale systems and NASA-backed design and modeling efforts under multiple SBIR grants.\nOur advantage lies in our aircraft-level configuration and systems integration - combining STOL aerodynamics, HEP, and scalable autonomy from the ground up. IP covers HEP architecture and configuration.\nWe’re engaging NASA, AFWERX, and direct DoD stakeholders to access field programs. On the commercial side, we’re targeting middle-mile logistics and time-sensitive medical transport.\nOur team includes aerospace engineers and PMs from Bombardier, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, McKinsey, and Amazon Prime Air.\nUnlike VTOLs or autonomy retrofits, Rune is purpose-built for contested logistics - balancing range, payload, and footprint like no one else.\nPrimary users: Air Mobility Command, expeditionary logistics officers, Marine Littoral Regiments, and SOCOM sustainment teams - whose daily challenge is delivering mission-critical cargo without relying on fuel convoys or fixed infrastructure.",

      "description": "Problem:\nModern EW training and deception missions lack affordable, modular systems that emit realistic RF signals across wide frequency ranges. Existing solutions are costly, inflexible, and hard to operate.\n\nSolution:\nThe Dynamic Radio Emulator System (DRES) is a low-cost, modular RF emitter covering 20 MHz–1 GHz and 20 MHz–6 GHz. Swappable amplifier modules let users tailor power and frequency output to mission needs. The system is remotely controlled via ATAK.\n\nField Validation & TRL:\nTRL 7 — Demonstrated in operational environments with 3rd Infantry Division at NTC, JRTC, JMRC, and with the Florida National Guard. Used at VANGUARD 2024 to simulate radar threats.\n\nStrategic Advantage:\nWe are patenting our system architecture, ATAK integration, and custom electronics. Combined with field-proven workflows and strong unit relationships, this creates both technical and relational barriers to entry.\n\nGo-to-Market Access:\nOur pricing is below key procurement thresholds, enabling units to buy using discretionary funds. This led to a $150k purchase by 3ID and $55k by FLNG, with multiple additional units preparing to procure. This bottom-up traction supports our path toward PEO EW&C.\n\nDual-Use Potential:\nOur long-range transceiver (TXVR) enables disaster response, off-grid comms, and remote industrial ops where infrastructure is limited.\n\nTeam:\nCo-Founders Joseph Petersen (CEO, Purdue ECE) and Alina Miles (CFO, ONU MechE) lead system development. \n\nCompetitive Landscape:\nDRES is more affordable, ATAK-integrated, and scalable than any alternative—supporting 20–40+ nodes in a mesh network. No other system offers this combination.\n\nPrimary User:\nCEMA operators from platoon NCOs to brigade-level leaders.\n\nUser-Critical Problem:\nCurrent systems delay training, require contractors, and limit control. Operators need scalable, fieldable emitters can be managed independently.",

      "description": "In modern forward-operating environments, the military’s reliance on diesel generators and fuel convoys creates serious vulnerabilities. Fuel convoys are among the most dangerous missions in the field, while generators are loud, hot, and maintenance-heavy — emitting detectable signatures that expose troops to enemy targeting. With electrification increasing across drone fleets, sensor platforms, and mobile comms, the battlefield demands a new standard of portable, resilient power.\n\nSunnoo delivers that standard. Our mobile, solar-powered microgrid provides silent, thermal-signature-free energy without the need for fuel. It eliminates logistical risk, reduces downtime, and enables mission continuity in contested environments — keeping warfighters powered, protected, and operational.\n\nKey features include a 12kW expandable solar array with patented dual-axis sun tracking — delivering 42% more solar capture than static systems — plus scalable battery storage (480kWh–1,440kWh), daisy-chain expandability, and a rugged, trailer-mounted design for fast deployment. Optional cloaking technology visually blends the unit with its terrain, enhancing stealth in high-threat zones.\n\nSunnoo is validated by 20,000+ hours of component testing and DOE partnerships via Sandia Labs and New Mexico State. At TRL 6, our platform is ready to move from field pilot to deployment. We’ve submitted multiple SBIR applications and built a go-to-market roadmap focused on DoD energy resilience needs.\n\nWith dual-use potential for disaster relief and EV infrastructure, Sunnoo offers not just a cleaner energy alternative — but a safer, smarter one that aligns with the modern warfighter’s reality. Built in the U.S.A. and deployable worldwide, it’s energy engineered for survivability and strategic advantage.",

      "description": "Problem\nJamming and spoofing attacks challenges PNT across the globe. T-ROK systems are expensive, large profile (targets) that need a lot of bandwidth to network. \n\nSolution\nZephr has built a capability to use smartphones (TAK devices) to create a sensor network to map areas of jamming/spoofing impact and geolocate emitters for targeting. It can run locally or networked.\n\nField Validation\nThe Zephr system has been extensively tested against jamming in Ukraine as well as teleportation/push spoofers in Israel. The team will be testing at APEX, Jammertest and UK NAVWAR.\n\nTechnology Maturity (TRL)\nTRL 7\n \nStrategic Advantage\nZephr uses the cheap omni-directional smartphone antennas to determine directionality + magnitude of jamming/spoofing attacks. Our multi-receiver networking capability fuses data into a COP. Patents 12,038,513, 12,061,268, 12,117,533\n\nGo-to-Market Access\nThe team has a D2P2 SBIR with AFRL to integrate with TAK. We've also worked with the NSIN Propel program, attending exercises above and partnered with TAG the MGUE prime. \n\nDual-Use Potential\nZephr's commercial positioning system and AI navigation for smartphones is being piloted by Honda, Suzuki, Meta, Grab, Uber, Overture, Ericsson, Rx Networks, Amazon and Samsung\n\nTeam\nThe Zephr team has built three previous startup in the geospatial domain with exits to ESRI, Maxar and Snapchat. The team is over 50% PhD's. \n\nCompetitive Landscape\nThe legacy T-ROK systems are sold by Thales/BAE - Zephr is cheaper, low profile, low weight, low bandwidth and integrates with TAK.\n\nPrimary User\nTAK users in contested environments - specifically CEWOs in SOCOM, Army, AFSOC\n\nUser-Critical Problem\nYour TAK device is being jammed or spoofed and you want to either target the emitter or maneuver around the impacted area.",

      "description": "Problem\nWe dominate in the air and at sea — but on the ground, $500 drones outmaneuver warfighters still aiming by hand. In close combat, even elite shooters miss — and that’s where we lose the advantage.\n\nSolution\nZeroMark adds real-time auto-aiming to rifles and weapon stations, physically steering the weapon like a gimbal so shooters stay on target — without changing how they operate or when they fire.\n\nField Validation\nLive-fire validated at TREX 25, L-SHORAD, and Red Sands Hard Kill.\n\nTechnology Maturity (TRL)\nTRL 7 — integrated into fielded weapons and proven on rifles, crew-served platforms, and vehicle-mounted systems in live-fire conditions.\n\nStrategic Advantage\nZeroMark requires no change to doctrine or behavior. Operators aim and fire as always. Our dataset enables real-time target segmentation — hitting motors, batteries, or electronics for maximum kill probability. No other system combines human-in-the-loop control with automated precision.\n\nGo-to-Market Access\nEngaged via AFWERX SBIR Phase III, JUON deployments, and OTs. Active with SOCOM, AFSOC, NSWC, and allied MODs. Integrating with primes on RWS and mobile C-UAS platforms.\n\nDual-Use Potential\nLaw enforcement, VIP security, infrastructure defense, and hunting safety — anywhere precise firearm use under pressure is critical.\n\nTeam\nFounded by MongoDB’s former CISO. Team includes Tier 1 operators, ex-Meta and Google AI leads, and BD leaders from Anduril. Tactical depth meets technical execution.\n\nCompetitive Landscape\nSmart Shooter gates the trigger. ZeroMark moves the weapon. We deliver physical auto-aiming with the shooter in control.\n\nPrimary User\nDismounted gunners & crew-served teams responsible for drone defeat and force protection.\n\nUser-Critical Problem\nWhen drones appear, gunners have seconds to aim and shoot. Under stress, they miss. ZeroMark keeps them locked on target and alive.",
