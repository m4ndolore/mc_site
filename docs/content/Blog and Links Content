### Article 2: The Pentagon's Counter-Drone Revolution - JIATF 401 and the New Marketplace

**Key Sources**:
- Defense One: "One-stop shopping for counter-drone gear is aim of joint task force" (Nov 2025)

- Three lines of effort: homeland defense, warfighter lethality, joint force training
- Groups 1-3 UAS threat focus (under 55 lbs)
- Implications for C-UAS vendors and the procurement path

**Editorial Angle**: This is a massive opportunity for defense tech companies. The Pentagon is essentially building an "app store" for counter-drone solutions. What does it take to get listed?

**Suggested Title Options**:
- "Inside JIATF 401: The Pentagon's New Counter-Drone Marketplace"
- "Counter-Drone 2.0: How the Pentagon Is Finally Streamlining C-UAS Procurement"

**Include**:
- Quote from Ross: "I only have one measure of effectiveness, and that's delivering state-of-the-art counter-UAS capability to the warfighter"

- Key architectures explained:
  - Data Enclave (Swivel Seat) vs Split Tenant
  - "Meet Me" Extranet Enclaves
  - GALSync solutions
- CMMC compliance implications
- Entra ID External Identities for B2B collaboration

**Editorial Angle**: Microsoft is positioning hard in the DIB identity space. For companies already using Tactical ID or similar solutions, this creates a "walled garden" tension. What should DIB companies consider when evaluating their identity architecture?

**Suggested Title Options**:

- TAK ecosystem: ATAK (Android), WinTAK, iTAK, TAK Server
- Plugin architecture and extensibility
- Integration with existing C2 systems

**Editorial Angle**: TAK represents the democratization of tactical awareness. Originally built for SOF, it's now spreading across conventional forces. What does this mean for defense tech companies building situational awareness tools?

**Suggested Title Options**:

**Terminated**:
- Airman Development Command (ADC) - AETC remains as-is
- Integrated Capabilities Command - folded into HQ AF A5/7
- ACC reorientation cancelled
- New Air Base Wings cancelled

**Editorial Angle**: "Innovation theater" vs actual change. What initiatives survived and what does that tell us about DAF priorities? The message: "fly, fix, fight" focus.

**Suggested Title Options**:
