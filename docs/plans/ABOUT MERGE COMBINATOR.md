ABOUT MERGE COMBINATOR
Hero
Merge Combinator is a venture studio for national security builders.
Focused on the Indo-Pacific, we co-found and build new ventures around urgent operational problems. Our model runs end-to-end: from operator-informed problem discovery through build, transition, and sustainment.

Why We Exist
National security innovation often stalls between prototype and fielded capability.
Operators encounter real operational gaps. Builders develop promising technologies. Capital moves cautiously. Programs of record move deliberately.
Merge exists to close that gap.
We align operators, technical builders, and capital from day one — structuring ventures around validated problems and building toward transition pathways from the outset.
We are ownership-driven and formation-focused. We are not a passive investor.
How We Work
1. Problem Discovery
We work with mission stakeholders to define operational gaps with clear relevance to national security priorities, particularly within the Indo-Pacific.
2. Venture Formation
We co-found companies with technical builders. Equity and governance are structured at formation, not retrofitted later.
3. Build & Validation
Ventures develop capabilities alongside problem owners, iterating toward operational relevance and early contracting pathways where appropriate.
4. Transition & Sustainment
We orient ventures toward durable alignment with programs, mission needs, and long-term viability.
Leadership
Paul “Gu$” Garcia
Founder & Managing Partner
Paul “Gu$” Garcia is the Founder and Managing Partner of Merge Combinator. A Weapons School graduate and former instructor fighter pilot, he flew combat missions in the F/A-18 across Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria, and later flew the F-22 with the Hawaii Air National Guard. He served as Officer in Charge of Homeland Defense for the Hawaii and Guam Air Defense Region in support of Operation Noble Eagle.
Since leaving the cockpit, Paul has focused on accelerating technology transition across the Indo-Pacific theater, architecting and delivering capabilities for advanced weapons systems. In prior roles, he supported capability transitions across major modernization efforts within the Department of Defense, including AI-enabled C2 and operational systems initiatives.
He previously founded SigmaBlox, the National Defense Tech Combine, convening warfighters, builders, and decision-makers to accelerate operationally relevant technology transition.

Doug Cummings
Principal, Autonomy
Doug Cummings leads autonomy-focused efforts at Merge Combinator. He brings over seven years of experience delivering AI/ML capabilities across the Department of Defense.
Most recently, Doug was a Senior Program Manager at Anduril Industries, where he led operational delivery efforts and scaled AI-enabled C2 and autonomous systems to Army customers. He previously held leadership roles within the DoD’s AI organizations, including the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) and Project Maven, supporting deployment of AI-enabled platforms across multiple combatant commands.
He holds an MBA from UC Berkeley and a BA from the University of Notre Dame.
The Combine
The Combine is a curated convening platform that brings together warfighters, builders, and decision-makers to accelerate operational technology transition. It directly supports Merge’s venture formation model by surfacing validated problems, aligning stakeholders, and identifying prospective co-founders.
The inaugural event convened approximately 150 participants across the defense innovation ecosystem.
FAQ
Is Merge a venture capital fund?
No. Merge is a venture studio. We co-found and build companies and take an active role in formation, development, and transition. Capital may be part of the model, but we are not a passive investor.
Do you provide advisory services or incubation?
Our primary focus is co-founding and building venture-backed national security companies.
We selectively engage in advisory and partnership work where it directly strengthens venture formation, operator access, or transition pathways. These efforts support the core studio model and are not standalone consulting services.
Who should reach out?
Technical builders ready to co-found
Builders with room on their cap table seeking aligned venture partnership
Mission owners with validated operational gaps
All engagement begins through structured access.
Do you work outside the Indo-Pacific?
Our primary focus is Indo-Pacific deterrence. Opportunities outside that scope must directly support national security objectives.
How is Merge different from traditional defense primes?
We build and scale new ventures alongside problem owners. We are not a systems integrator or a services contractor.
Do you publish portfolio companies?
Portfolio companies and partnerships are announced only when approved for public release.
