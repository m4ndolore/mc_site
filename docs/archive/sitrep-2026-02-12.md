# Sitrep - 2026-02-12

## Session Summary

**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Focus**: UX polish requirements (REQ-UX-002, REQ-UX-003, REQ-UX-004)

## Completed

### REQ-UX-002: Dark Theme Unification (COMPLETE)

**Finding**: Dark theme consolidation was already mostly done from a previous session.

- `styles.css` body defaults to dark (`var(--black)`, `var(--offwhite)`)
- Dark theme rules already merged into `styles.css` (lines 4695-5588)
- `builders.css` already dark-native

**Actions taken**:
- Removed `dark-theme.css` import from `programs/the-combine.html`
- Deleted `dark-theme.css` (930 lines - redundant)
- Deleted `styles/builders-dark.css` (169 lines - never imported)

**Committed**: Yes, as `feat(REQ-UX-002): Dark theme consolidation - delete redundant CSS`

### REQ-UX-003: Add Missing Footers (IN PROGRESS)

**Pages requiring footer work**:
| Page | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| `access.html` | No footer | Full footer added |
| `guild.html` | No footer | Full footer added |
| `wingman.html` | Simple 5-link footer | Full footer (upgraded) |
| `briefs.html` | Simple 5-link footer | Full footer (upgraded) |
| `dashboard.html` | No footer | Intentionally omitted (C2UX) |
