# Stakeholder Update Post Template

**Audience**: All Ghost contributors  
**Purpose**: Provide a consistent structure for stakeholder updates that highlight value, traction, and asks.

## How to Use in Ghost
1. In Ghost Admin, click **New post** and switch the editor to **Markdown** (or insert a Markdown card) for the initial scaffold.  
2. Paste the template below, replace placeholders, then switch back to cards/paragraphs as needed.  
3. For hero images, video embeds, social embeds, or CTA buttons, convert the relevant section into Ghost cards:  
   - **Image/Card**: drag in the image card and upload your hero asset.  
   - **Video**: paste a YouTube/Vimeo link on its own line or use the `/video` card.  
   - **Social embeds**: paste the URL from LinkedIn, X, Instagram, etc., and Ghost will auto-embed.  
4. Update the CTA link + preferred email before publishing.  
5. Tag the post with `stakeholder-update` so it’s easy to find later.

## Tips
- Keep sections factual but energetic—stakeholders skim for outcomes and asks.  
- If a section is N/A, delete the heading so the post feels intentional.  
- Reuse the template for recurring updates by duplicating an older post in Ghost and refreshing the details.
